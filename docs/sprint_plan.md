## Sprint 2: Model Development & Framework Comparison (Weeks 3-4)

*   **Goal:** Implement and benchmark a variety of recommendation models using popular machine learning frameworks.
*   **Timeline:** Weeks 3-4
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Content-based recommendation models using Hugging Face Transformers.
    *   Custom deep learning models for collaborative filtering and VAEs in PyTorch.
    *   Wide & Deep and other production-focused models in TensorFlow.
    *   A comprehensive report comparing the performance, training time, and inference latency of each model.

## Sprint 3: Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Comparison (Weeks 5-6)

*   **Goal:** Deploy the recommendation models to the three major cloud platforms and evaluate their performance, cost, and ease of use.
*   **Timeline:** Weeks 5-6
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Deployment of models to AWS SageMaker, including both real-time endpoints and batch transform jobs.
    *   Deployment of models to Google Cloud Vertex AI, with a focus on custom containers and batch prediction.
    *   Deployment of models to Azure Machine Learning, utilizing Azure Container Instances.
    *   A detailed comparison of the three cloud providers for this specific recommendation use case.

## Sprint 4: MLOps & Experiment Management (Weeks 7-8)

*   **Goal:** Implement a robust MLOps workflow for experiment tracking, A/B testing, and model monitoring.
*   **Timeline:** Weeks 7-8
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   An MLflow server for tracking all experiments, model artifacts, and results.
    *   A custom A/B testing framework for comparing different recommendation strategies in a live environment.
    *   A model monitoring system to detect data and concept drift.

## Sprint 5: Advanced Analytics & Business Intelligence (Weeks 9-10)

*   **Goal:** Build a business intelligence dashboard and perform advanced analytics to extract deeper insights from the data.
*   **Timeline:** Weeks 9-10
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   A Streamlit-based executive dashboard to visualize key business metrics and model performance.
    *   Advanced analytics pipelines for user segmentation, cohort analysis, and customer lifetime value prediction.
    *   An analysis of the effectiveness of cross-domain transfer learning.

## Sprint 6: Production Optimization & Final Integration (Weeks 11-12)

*   **Goal:** Optimize the system for production, ensure scalability, and conduct thorough end-to-end testing.
*   **Timeline:** Weeks 11-12
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   An intelligent caching layer for recommendations to reduce latency.
    *   Auto-scaling configurations for the recommendation services on each cloud platform.
    *   A comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and load tests.
    *   Final project documentation and a presentation summarizing the results.
