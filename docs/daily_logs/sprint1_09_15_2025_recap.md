## Summary of Work Completed

Today's session focused on validating the project's data state and then prototyping a first-pass recommendation model. 

1.  **Data Validation:** We began by assessing the sprint plan. To verify the state of the data, we created a `query_db.py` script and a `query_db_tables.sh` shell script to automate checking record counts in the databases against source file line counts. This confirmed that while database tables existed, they were not populated.

2.  **Initial Data Loading:** We successfully loaded the `Subscription_Boxes` dataset into MongoDB, confirming the batch-loading process works.

3.  **Model 1: Behavioral Clustering:** We prototyped an end-to-end recommendation model based on user *behavior*.
    *   **Feature Engineering:** We created a user profile DataFrame based on reviewing habits (`n_reviews`, `mean_rating`, review length, helpful votes, etc.).
    *   **Clustering:** We implemented a sophisticated pipeline using `MiniBatchKMeans` to segment users, and used the Elbow method and Silhouette scores to determine the optimal number of clusters.
    *   **Persona Identification:** From the cluster analysis, we identified three distinct user personas: "The Expert Reviewer," "The Quietly Satisfied," and "The Unhappy Customer."
    *   **Recommendation Generation:** We successfully generated a top-5 list of recommended products for each behavioral cluster.

## Discoveries & Strategic Pivot

The most significant development of the day was a key strategic insight.

*   **Discovery:** We realized that clustering users by their *reviewing behavior* is not the best way to predict their *product tastes*. The personas we found are useful for understanding user engagement, but not for recommending specific types of products.

*   **Change in Direction:** Based on this insight, we pivoted to a new, more powerful model: **Taste-Based Clustering**. The goal of this new model is to segment users based on the shared attributes of the products they buy and review, which is a much more direct way to model user taste.

## Snafus & Resolutions

We encountered and resolved several technical challenges:

1.  **Jupyter Notebook Corruption (`NotJSONError`):** We faced a persistent issue where the notebook file for our modeling was being written in a corrupted format. After multiple failed attempts to fix the file content, we resolved this by creating a minimal, blank notebook and then pasting the necessary code into it manually.

2.  **Metadata Merge Failure (`KeyError: 'asin'`):** Our initial attempt to merge review data with product metadata failed. Through a step-by-step debugging process, we discovered that the metadata collection did not use the `'asin'` field as its primary identifier. 
    *   **Resolution:** We inspected a raw metadata document, identified `'parent_asin'` as the correct key, and successfully rewrote the query and merge logic to use this key.

3.  **Data Type Errors (`TypeError`, `SyntaxError`):** We resolved a `TypeError` from attempting to JSON-serialize a MongoDB `ObjectId` by using a direct `print()` instead. We also fixed a `SyntaxError` caused by a missing parenthesis in a generated code snippet.

## Current Status & Next Steps

*   **Current Status:** We have successfully executed the first step of our new "Taste-Based Clustering" strategy. We have a merged DataFrame (`merged_df`) that combines 100,000 reviews with their corresponding rich product metadata.

*   **What's Next:** The immediate next step is to use this `merged_df` to build a "taste profile" for each user. We have the code ready to create a `user_taste_df` where each user is represented by a vector of product categories they have purchased. Following that, we will apply K-Means clustering to these new taste-based profiles to create our new, more powerful user segments and generate a new set of recommendations.
- 3. Create User Taste Profile from Categories ---
    2 
    3 # The 'categories' column contains lists of categories. Let's 
      expand it.
    4 # This creates a new row for each category an item belongs to.
    5 exploded_df = merged_df.explode('categories')
    6 
    7 print("✅ DataFrame exploded by category.")
    8 
    9 # Now, count how many times each user reviewed an item in each
      category.
   10 user_category_counts = exploded_df.groupby(['user_id', 
      'categories']).size().reset_index(name='review_count')
   11 
   12 print("✅ User-category counts calculated.")
   13 
   14 # --- Pivot this into a user-taste DataFrame ---
   15 # This creates our "taste vector" where each column represents
      a category.
   16 user_taste_df = user_category_counts.pivot_table(
   17     index='user_id',
   18     columns='categories',
   19     values='review_count',
   20     fill_value=0 # If a user never reviewed a category, the 
      count is 0
   21 )
   22 
   23 print("\n✅ Successfully created the user taste profile 
      DataFrame.")
   24 print("\nUser Taste DataFrame Info:")
   25 user_taste_df.info()
   26 
   27 print("\nUser Taste DataFrame Head:")
   28 print(user_taste_df.head())

  This user_taste_df is the feature set we will use for your new 
  clustering model.
