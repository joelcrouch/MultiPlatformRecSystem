# Daily Log: September 14, 2025

**Sprint:** 1

---

### Today's Goal

- Set up the project structure and development environment.
- Begin implementation of the data ingestion pipelines as per Sprint 1.

---

### Achievements

- Created a comprehensive directory structure for the project (`data`, `src`, `docs`, etc.).
- Established a `docs` folder with the project design, sprint plan, and daily logs.
- Set up a conda virtual environment (`recsys`) with Python 3.9.
- Populated `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies and installed them.
- Created the `MultiDomainDatasetIntegrator` class in `src/data/data_loader.py`.
- Implemented a method to automatically download and extract the MovieLens 25M dataset.
- Created the initial `RealtimeRecommendationPipeline` class in `src/pipelines/streaming_pipeline.py` with placeholder methods for real-time processing.

---

### Problems Encountered

- The initial `pip install` command failed due to the conda environment not being active (`externally-managed-environment` error).
- The `data_loader.py` script was initially missing the logic to download the MovieLens dataset, only process it.

---

### Methods to Fix

#### Successes

- **Method:** The environment issue was resolved by ensuring the `recsys` conda environment was activated in the terminal before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Reason:** This directed the installation to the correct, isolated Python environment.

- **Method:** The data loader was improved by adding a new `download_movielens_data` method that uses `urllib` and `zipfile` to fetch and extract the data automatically.
- **Reason:** This makes the data ingestion process more robust and self-contained.

---

### End of Day Status

The foundational scripts for both batch data loading (`data_loader.py`) and real-time stream processing (`streaming_pipeline.py`) are now in place. The development environment is fully configured.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Set up local instances of Kafka and Redis to test the `RealtimeRecommendationPipeline`.
2.  Begin work on the third deliverable of Sprint 1: the multi-database feature store as outlined in `src/features/multi_db_feature_store.py`.
